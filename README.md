- 👋 Hi, I’m @Evalea4483 -- Gwendolyn Stephenson
- 👀 I’m interested in Quantum algorithms and quantum computation, Software development, game development, and anything tech related.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science, and Machine Learning techniques
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ny project ultimately!
- 📫 you can reach me by my email which is probably best: gmstephenson1999@gmail.com or vorduzk@gmail.com


 ✨I’m quick to learn new tech and frameworks and don’t hesitate to research what’s needed to finish the job. I’m seeking test- and data-driven experience in real-world applications, especially toward game development.
 ✨Game development is my ultimate long-term goal; I know I have more to learn, and I’m highly coachable and eager to grow with guidance from the team and contribute meaningfully to every project.
